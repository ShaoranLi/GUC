# GUC
Codes for TMC submission "Achieving Real-Time Spectrum Sharing in 5G Underlay Coexistence with Channel Uncertainty"

# Notes
* Test of GUC algorithm in comparison with Gurobi on CPU. Use "solve_opt_GUC_corr.m" as the run file
* For GUC test, be sure to use a CUDA compatible device.
* For Gurobi on CPU, be sure to install cvx and Gurobi in MATLAB
* CUDA files are complied into .exe files for the conveneinece of tests. To change the CUDA executions, use the two .cu files and compile them into .exe file to run tests.
